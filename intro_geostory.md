# 🚂 🍂 Geostory for the introduction

> Every autumn rail networks across the world suffer delays, accidents and
> schedule changes due to low friction problems caused by leaves landing on the
> rails. These leaves form a layer that can reduce the friction between the
> wheel and the rail to a similar level as that between ice and an ice-skate

> Railway authorities in many countries like USA, Canada, UK, Germany, etc. face the problem of tree leaves falling on railway tracks and roads during the autumn season. When trains and vehicles travel over these leaves, they get pressed into a slippery layer on the surface of tracks and roads respectively. This layer causes road accidents and overshooting of trains, causing the train to cover longer distance to halt.
